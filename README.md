## Address Book Update


</div>

### Description

Heres the update to my Address Book Example that pulls it information from an

Access Database. I finally added the search and delete functions because I got tired of getting email from people asking me to write the update. :) Sorry it took so long but I've been busy opening up my office... Email any questions you have or comments to plexxonic@softhome.net
 
### More Info
 
Might be some bugs... Not sure I wrote it in 1 minute at 3:00 in the morning...
